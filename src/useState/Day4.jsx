// Day 4 Challenge: Form with Real-Time Validation and Custom Hook
// In this challenge, you'll create a form that provides real-time validation feedback to the user as they type. Additionally, you'll extract the form logic into a custom hook to handle form state and validation.

// Objective:
// Create a form with fields like name, email, and password.
// Implement real-time validation for each field:
// The name should not be empty.
// The email should follow a valid email format.
// The password should be at least 8 characters long.
// Display validation messages as the user types.
// Create a custom hook, useForm, to manage form state and validation logic.
// Step-by-Step Instructions:
// Create the Form Component:

// Render the form with the input fields.
// Handle form submission.
// Implement Validation Logic:

// Add validation rules for each input field (e.g., check if the email is in the correct format).
// Show error messages when the validation fails.
// Create the useForm Custom Hook:

// This hook will handle the form state and validation.
// It should return the form values, validation errors, and functions to update the state.
